## WHAT ARE COMPONENTS IN REACT

components are reusable class/functions which contains the JSX.
One file can have multiple classes/function, therefore it can have multiple components.
components can return the JSX.
Components have to be exported.
To maintain cleaner code structure. We create a directory called as components inside the src.
The Component name should follow PascalCasing. Otherwise it will not work.
Inside components we put all the various components that we will be using.
